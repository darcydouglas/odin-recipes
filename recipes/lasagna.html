        <li>Ground beef or a mix of beef and pork</li>
        <li>Onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh basil and oregano (or dried herbs)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>For béchamel: butter, flour, milk, and a pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese (optional for some recipes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat the olive oil and sauté onions and garlic until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, melt butter for the béchamel. Once melted, stir in the flour and cook for a couple of minutes. Gradually add milk while stirring to prevent lumps. Season with a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Cook until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a layer of meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, and if you're using ricotta, add a layer of it here.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers (meat sauce, noodles, béchamel, cheeses) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for about 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
